# TO-GIVE

What is this thing?

Just a simple to-do app (with a twist) to familiarize myself with Laravel.

## Code Highlights

I set a route: [View Code](routes/web.php)

Wrote up the controller: [View Code](app/Http/Controllers/TodoController.php)

Related the user model and todo model: [User](app/Models/User.php) | [Todo](app/Models/Todo.php)

And built the frontend:
- [Default Layout](resources/js/Layouts/DefaultLayout.jsx)
- [Todo](resources/js/Components/Todo.jsx)
- [NewTodoForm](resources/js/Components/NewTodoForm.jsx)
- [EditTodoForm](resources/js/Components/EditTodoForm.jsx)
